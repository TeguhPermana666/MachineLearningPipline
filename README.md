| Dataset | [Diabetes prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset) |
| Problem |Diabetes or sugar disease is a chronic (long-term) disease that needs to be watched out for. The main sign of diabetes is an increase in blood sugar (glucose) levels above normal values. Diabetes occurs when the sufferer's body is no longer able to take sugar (glucose) into cells and use it as energy. This condition ultimately results in the accumulation of extra sugar in the body's bloodstream. The death rate caused by diabetes is quite high. In 2021, diabetes has caused 6.7 million deaths worldwide in 2021. This means there is 1 death every 5 seconds. The dataset used is a prediction dataset which is a collection of data containing medical information about a number of individuals, including parameters such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and others. This dataset is very relevant to the problem that has been explained previously. In this problem, it has been revealed that diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide and can cause death if not treated properly. By utilizing this dataset, medical information obtained from patients can be analyzed to predict the likelihood of someone having diabetes. Thus, this dataset can be an important tool in the prevention and management of this disease, helping to reduce the death rate caused by diabetes. The relationship of the dataset to the problem at hand is in the form of prediction or early diagnosis of the patient whether they have diabetes or not based on the data features in the dataset (gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, bmi, smoking_history, bload_glucosa_level, hbA1c_level) which have been trained using machine learning algorithms so that they can help identify risk factors related to diabetes and enable more effective prevention or treatment efforts|
| Solution Machine Learning | To detect diabetes, patients usually undergo a blood sugar level check. Doctors cannot immediately conclude whether a patient has diabetes just from checking blood sugar levels. With a diabetes classification system using machine learning, doctors are expected to gain knowledge about diabetes in patients that will be used for consideration and examination of patients in the future |
| Processing method | In this case, there are nine features where eight will be used for classification features, and one as a class, there are two categorical features and six numerical, then the data will be split into 80:20 for train and eval data. The transform process will be renaming for the transformed features, one hot encoding for class data |
| Model Architecture | For the model architecture itself, for each layer using Dense 256, Dense 64, Dense 16 with activation relu, then the last layer uses Dense 1 with activation sigmoid because it will classify classes that only have two values, namely diabetes and not diabetes. For the compile model using Adam optimizers with a learning_rate of 0.001, loss binary_crossentropy with metrics BinaryAccuracy |
| Evaluation Matrices |The evaluation metrics used are AUC, Precision, Recall, Example Count and BinaryAccuracy|
| Model Performance | For model performance, in terms of accuracy and loss, the accuracy obtained is quite high with an accuracy of 0.97 in the training and validation process, and the loss obtained in the training and validation process is 0.0817 so that this model is quite good for classification |
| Deployment Option | Untuk deployment, sistem ini akan dideploy menggunakan platform railway |
| Web app | [diabetes-classification](https://diabetes-classification-production.up.railway.app/v1/models/diabetes-classification-model/metadata)|
| Monitoring | Monitoring on this system is done using Prometheus and Grafana. Here only the monitoring process is carried out to display incoming requests to the system that will display the status of each request made, in this system there are three statuses displayed, namely if the request process in the classification system is not found, invalid argument and the classification process is successfully marked with OK |
